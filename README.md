This was a project I created during grad school

# AML Commercial Model Robustness
 Testing the robustness of three state-of-the-art commercial image recognition models to adversarial attacks

 main.py generate adversarial images - specifies 20 images from imagenet, choice of either pretrained resnet or pretrained googlenet, 3 attacks, and 6 different perturbation epsilons per attack

 gcvtest.py runs adversarial images on the googlecloudvision API - tests a single folder of pertured images per model - wont actually run, needs user .json which is hidden from git
 
 pics folder contains final adversarial images used to test google classifier

graphs folder contains final outputs for each pretrained network and each attack on google vision
